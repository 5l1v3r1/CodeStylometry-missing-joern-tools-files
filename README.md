Missing Files from Joern-Tools for CodeStylometry
==========================
This project contains files which are not present in octopus-platform/joern-tools which are used in FeatureCalculators.java in calaylin/CodeStylometry.

I did not create these files. I am posting them here because they are currently difficult, if not impossible, to obtain without contacting the authors and recieving them by email.

Unfortunately, they will need to be manually inserted into the joern-tools install in order to work properly.

This project also contains the gremlin plugin to be placed in the plugins folder of neo4j, to reduce the number of steps necessary to get the project going. I also did not create these.
